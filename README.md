# GoHacks
SheHack2019 Hackathon Delivery Boy management third party tool

Golang (backend)
GRPC (unary and server streaming API call)
Protocol buffer(for serializing structured data)
Mongo db (database)

Intended approach 
We have implemented the scenarios using grpc services which will communicate to mysql database and for the client server interaction.
We/anyone can create a new services in any language and add the functionality into the existing project. This is the beauty of micro services.
